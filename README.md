## Progressbar
class project 

the objective was to create a progressbar in Ruby. We incorpirated this with a weather app. The user is able to input the temperature from the past weeks and it will be returned in a table and the temperature will in either red or blue depending on the temp returned. 

in the project I have used two gems:
#### Paint
```sh
$ install gem paint 
```
&
#### Table
```sh
$ install gem terminal-table
```
